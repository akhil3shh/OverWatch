# Overwatch

Thanks for your interest!

This project is inspired by the classic arcade style shooting gallery games!

Tools used:  Python, PyGame framework, Canva Pro

The entire project has been built from scratch. Static images are used as backgrounds. Tiers of proceedurally drawn targets are animated onto each level and we get them 
moving and checked if the player has shot. Once the player clears a full level of targets, they proceed to the next level. Needless to say, with each level the 
difficulty of the game increases. 

Various functionalities like pause, game over and main menu have also been created. High scores are stored in an external text file that we read in from when the game 
boots up and write to it any time there is a new high score during gameplay. All graphics used are created using Canva Pro and music files have been used from the 
internet.

Feel free to reach out for any constructive feedback!
